# Evaluation Planner - AI-Powered Nonprofit Program Evaluation Planning

## Overview
This React/TypeScript application, built with Vite, assists nonprofit organizations in creating comprehensive evaluation plans for their programs. It features a multi-step wizard guiding users through program information collection, web scraping, AI-powered analysis, evaluation framework generation, and HTML report generation. The project aims to streamline the evaluation planning process for nonprofits, offering significant market potential by providing an accessible and intelligent tool for program assessment and improvement.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
The application is built with React 18.3.1 and TypeScript, utilizing Vite 5.4.2 for development and building. Styling uses CSS Modules exclusively (no Tailwind), complemented by Lucide React for icons. The user interface is a multi-step wizard with progress tracking, designed to be modern and responsive.

**UI Design (October 2025)**: The application uses a clean 3-phase progress indicator instead of showing all 6 backend steps. The phases are configured in `config/workflow.ts`:
- **Phase 1: Program Setup** (steps 1-2) - User input and content extraction
- **Phase 2: AI Analysis** (steps 3-5) - AI processing and framework generation  
- **Phase 3: Your Report** (step 6) - Final report generation

This simplified design reduces visual clutter while maintaining transparency through status messages that show what the AI is currently doing (e.g., "Analyzing program model...", "Building evaluation framework..."). The workflow configuration is flexible and remix-friendly - future implementations can easily customize phase labels, groupings, and status messages by editing `config/workflow.ts`.

**CSS Architecture**: All styling uses CSS Modules (`App.module.css`, `StepProgress.module.css`, `PromptAdmin.module.css`) for scoped, maintainable styles. The modules implement a mobile-first responsive design with breakpoints at 640px (mobile), 768px (tablets), and 1024px (desktop). Color variables are defined in CSS custom properties for easy theming.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - Styling Guidelines for Future Development**:
- **DO NOT add Tailwind CSS** - This project intentionally uses pure CSS Modules with CSS custom properties
- **DO use CSS custom properties** for theming - All colors and key values are defined as CSS variables (e.g., `--color-primary`, `--color-completed`)
- **DO edit CSS Module files** directly for styling changes - This approach is simpler, more maintainable, and easier to remix
- **Changing colors/theme**: Edit the CSS custom properties at the top of CSS Module files (particularly `App.module.css`)
- **Why no Tailwind**: The project previously had Tailwind but removed it in October 2025 because all styles were already in CSS Modules. Keeping Tailwind would create duplicate color definitions and unnecessary build complexity.

### Backend and Core Functionality
The application integrates with Supabase for backend services. Key features include URL extraction and robust web scraping with error handling, retry logic, and concurrent processing. AI-powered analysis and evaluation framework generation are central to the system. Prompts for AI models are managed through a comprehensive admin interface, stored in a PostgreSQL database. Email delivery of reports is handled by Resend.

**Security Architecture - Three-Tier API Key Management (October 2025)**:
The application implements a secure three-tier architecture that keeps API keys safe and allows remixability:

1. **Backend Proxy Layer** (`server.js`):
   - All OpenRouter API calls go through the backend proxy endpoint `/api/openrouter/chat/completions`
   - API keys are NEVER exposed to the frontend code
   - Frontend components send a `step` parameter (prompt1, prompt2, or report_template) instead of model/API key
   - Backend looks up the appropriate model and temperature for that step from settings

2. **Database Settings Storage**:
   - Settings table stores OpenRouter API key and model configurations
   - Administrators can update settings through the admin UI without redeployment
   - Settings accessible via GET/PUT `/api/settings` endpoints (password-protected)

3. **Environment Variable Fallbacks**:
   - If no database setting exists, system falls back to environment variables
   - Environment variables: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `PROMPT1_MODEL`, `PROMPT2_MODEL`, `REPORT_TEMPLATE_MODEL`
   - This ensures the system works immediately after forking/remixing

**Why This Architecture?**
- **Security**: API keys never touch the frontend, preventing exposure in browser dev tools
- **Remixable**: Others can fork this project and configure their own API keys via admin UI or environment variables
- **Flexible**: Administrators can change AI models and settings without code changes or redeployment

**Automatic Data Injection (Admin-Proof System)**: The system uses automatic context injection to ensure all input data flows correctly through the AI workflow, regardless of how admin users edit prompt templates. Admin users only need to write natural instructions in their prompts - the system automatically prepends all program information (organization name, program name, description, scraped web content) and previous step outputs (program analysis, evaluation framework) before the admin's instructions. This eliminates the need for admins to understand placeholder syntax like `{{variableName}}` and prevents data loss from template editing mistakes. Implementation uses `buildPromptWithContext()` helper function in `promptApi.ts` that structures context data with clear section headers before appending admin templates.

**Contextual Label Preservation**: When users provide URLs with descriptive labels (e.g., "Program info: https://example.com" or "About organization: https://example2.com"), the system preserves this contextual information throughout the scraping and AI analysis pipeline. The `extractLabeledUrls()` function in `url.ts` captures both the label and URL, scraped content is stored with its associated label in `labeledScrapedContent[]`, and `buildPromptWithContext()` formats this data with clear section headers (e.g., "--- PROGRAM INFO ---") so the AI can properly contextualize information from each source. This ensures the AI understands the purpose and context of each scraped webpage, leading to more accurate analysis.

**Naming Convention**: The application uses a consistent naming scheme across components, database identifiers, and settings keys:
- **Components**: `Prompt1.tsx`, `Prompt2.tsx`, `ReportTemplate.tsx`
- **Database identifiers**: `prompt1`, `prompt2`, `report_template`
- **Settings keys**: `prompt1_model`, `prompt2_model`, `report_template_model`, `prompt1_temperature`, `prompt2_temperature`, `report_template_temperature`
- **Environment variable fallbacks**: `PROMPT1_MODEL`, `PROMPT2_MODEL`, `REPORT_TEMPLATE_MODEL`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

### Deployment and Environment
The project is configured for a Reserved VM deployment on Replit, running a two-server setup. The frontend serves on port 5000, and an internal Express.js server handles API requests and email functionality on port 3001, with Vite proxying `/api/*` requests.

### Admin Interface
A secure, session-based authentication system protects the admin interface, which allows for managing AI prompts, viewing system configurations (LLM models, temperatures, web search settings, email settings), and managing email delivery templates. Prompts can be edited using a markdown editor, with support for version history and rollbacks. The configuration panel displays web search status for each prompt with clear visual indicators (üåê Enabled/Disabled).

### HTML Report Generation
HTML reports are generated using the `marked` library, incorporating logic model SVG diagrams, enhanced table styling, and responsive design, with options for direct download or email delivery.
