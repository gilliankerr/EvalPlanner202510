The approach is collaborative and aims to provide actionable insights for program staff, management, and funders. It is guided by the principles of practical, utilization-focused evaluation.</p><p>This plan does not include citations or research references. It is based on the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4815131">LogicalOutcomes Evaluation Planning Handbook</a> by Gillian Kerr and Sophie Llewelyn, which describes a structured process that relies on general evidence about effective nonprofit programs, supported by an in-depth web search.</p><p>We recommend that users also carry out a literature review to check that the evaluation plan is supported by peer-reviewed evidence in research journals. Our current recommended AI literature search tools are <a href="https://www.undermind.ai/">Undermind</a> followed by <a href="https://platform.futurehouse.org/">FutureHouse Falcon</a> and <a href="https://consensus.app/">Consensus</a>. The <a href="https://www.undermind.ai/">Undermind</a> prompt should be something like, "I want to find empirical research (including peer-reviewed publications and high-quality gray literature) identifying essential program delivery elements and critical success factors for [type of program] serving [brief description of target population]." <a href="https://www.undermind.ai/">Undermind</a> will then interview you to refine the prompt. You can then re-do this evaluation plan app and paste in the relevant parts of the literature review into 'About the program'.</p><section class="content-section"><h2 id="program-summary-and-analysis">Program summary and analysis</h2><h3 id="summary-of-the-program">Summary of the program</h3><p>According to Black Health Alliance’s website, the organization is a community-led registered charity working to improve the health and well-being of Black communities in Canada. BHA centres Black communities in defining challenges and co-designing solutions, and focuses its work through three pillars: Health Promotion &amp; Community Engagement; Research and Policy; and Strategy, Design &amp; Implementation. Strategic focus areas include the social determinants of health, health inequities, anti-Black racism, and building connected communities.</p><p>Based on the program model research from the previous analysis, “All Programs” functions as a set of coordinated initiatives that convene partners, co-design solutions with Black community members, develop and mobilize evidence, and support policy and systems change. The program aims to reduce health inequities, improve access and quality of services, and strengthen connected communities across Canada.</p><h3 id="program-overview">Program overview</h3><p>According to the program description, BHA addresses key issues impacting Black communities in Canada by combining community engagement and health promotion with community-based research, policy work, and support for strategy, design, and implementation. BHA positions Black community members as co-leaders in defining problems and crafting solutions, and it works with multisector partners to implement those solutions.</p><p>Programs of this type typically provide a mix of direct engagement (e.g., forums, campaigns, navigation), knowledge products (e.g., research reports, policy briefs), and implementation supports (e.g., co-design sprints, technical assistance, training). The general journey for a Black community member starts with accessible engagement or outreach, opportunities to inform program design, and participation in health promotion activities. For partner organizations and systems, the journey includes engagement, co-design of changes, training and coaching to adopt equity practices, and support to collect and use race-based and equity data ethically.</p><p>Based on the previous analysis, intended outcomes flow from increased awareness and trust, to adoption of equity-informed policies and practices, to sustained improvements in access, quality, and health outcomes for Black communities. BHA’s strategic plan (2022–2025) guides multi-year initiatives across these pillars.</p><h3 id="activities">Activities</h3><p>Activities are organized using Black Health Alliance’s own pillars and language.</p><p>• Health promotion &amp; community engagement</p><ul><li>Hosting community forums, dialogues, and listening sessions</li><li>Co-creating and delivering culturally relevant health promotion campaigns</li><li>Mobilizing community ambassadors and peer outreach</li><li>Providing navigation, referral, and accompaniment to services</li><li>Convening co-design workshops with Black community members</li></ul><p>• Research and policy</p><ul><li>Conducting community-based and participatory research projects</li><li>Developing evidence syntheses, reports, and policy briefs</li><li>Supporting ethical race-based and equity data collection and governance</li><li>Engaging in policy analysis and advocacy with decision-makers</li></ul><p>• Strategy, design &amp; implementation</p><ul><li>Running co-design sprints and prototyping solutions with partners</li><li>Providing implementation support, training, and coaching to organizations</li><li>Brokering cross-sector partnerships and shared measurement</li><li>Supporting quality improvement and change management in partner sites</li></ul><p>• Cross-cutting capacity building and knowledge mobilization</p><ul><li>Delivering anti-Black racism and cultural safety training</li><li>Developing and sharing toolkits, curricula, and resources</li><li>Maintaining data stewardship, privacy, and evaluation systems</li><li>Disseminating knowledge through events, dashboards, and communications</li></ul><h3 id="key-management-processes">Key management processes</h3><p>Several management processes must be properly implemented for an effective program. The following processes are defined in the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4815131">LogicalOutcomes Evaluation Planning Handbook</a>, supplemented by a web search and adapted to Black Health Alliance.</p><p>• Feedback and quality control: Establish a continuous feedback loop that includes Black community member input from forums, surveys, and listening sessions; partner feedback from debriefs; and routine quality checks on training, co-design sessions, and knowledge products. Use rapid-cycle learning (e.g., short pulse surveys, post-event reflections) to inform program adjustments.</p><p>• Participatory decision-making: Engage Black community members as co-designers and advisors with paid roles and clear decision-making power. Use structured advisory groups and participatory sense-making sessions to shape priorities, interpret findings, and guide adaptations across all pillars.</p><p>• Staff development: Provide ongoing training in anti-Black racism, cultural safety, trauma- and violence-informed approaches, CBPR methods, facilitation, implementation coaching, and data ethics. Pair training with mentorship, peer learning, and reflective practice.</p><p>• Resource management: Track budgets, staff effort, and in-kind contributions across initiatives to ensure sustainability and alignment with the 2022–2025 strategic plan. Prioritize resources for community compensation, accessibility supports, and data stewardship.</p><p>• Partnership management: Maintain MOUs, shared goals, and clear roles with health, social, education, and government partners. Facilitate regular partnership meetings, shared measurement, and joint problem-solving to align activities and avoid duplication.</p><p>• Ethical race-based data governance: Implement transparent consent, privacy, and data minimization protocols; establish community oversight for data use; ensure compliance with relevant laws and standards; and provide staff training on data ethics and equity.</p><p>• Knowledge mobilization and communications: Plan targeted dissemination for each product (briefs, toolkits, dashboards), tailoring messages to Black community members, providers, and policy audiences. Track reach, engagement, and use to improve future outputs.</p><h3 id="main-interest-groups">Main interest groups</h3><table class="standard-table"><thead><tr><th>Interest group</th><th>What they hope for</th><th>Risks from their perspective</th><th>Risk mitigation strategies</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Black community members (diverse diasporas, ages, genders, newcomers, LGBTQ2S+, people with disabilities)</td><td>Respectful engagement;

The phases are designed to build on each other, from foundational planning and engagement to data analysis and reporting. The intent is to focus evaluation resources as much as possible on understanding and responding to interest group perspectives and on improving program quality.</p><p>The evaluation project includes the following activities divided into four overlapping phases:</p><ul><li>Planning and initiation: Activities 1 – 5 (duration: 3 to 8 weeks)</li><li>Design and development: Activities 5 – 9 (duration: 1 to 12 weeks)</li><li>Implementation and analysis: Activities 9 – 11 (ongoing until project completion)</li><li>Communication and discussion: Activities 11 – 12 (duration: 3 to 6 weeks)</li></ul><h3 id="phase-1-engage-the-project-sponsor-team-members-and-key-decision-makers">Phase 1. Engage the project sponsor, team members, and key decision-makers</h3><ul><li>Confirm evaluation scope, budget and delivery date for the final report.</li><li>Define the main roles and responsibilities for the evaluation project, including the manager who is overseeing the project and who will be taking the recommendations to senior management.</li><li>Identify and invite members to an Evaluation Advisory Committee.</li><li>Define the timelines, resources (including staff effort for interviews and data collection) and the decision process for approval of final report.</li></ul><h3 id="phase-2-define-evaluation-objectives-and-questions">Phase 2. Define evaluation objectives and questions</h3><ul><li>Facilitate a meeting with the advisory committee to discuss and revise the evaluation objectives and questions.</li><li>Ensure evaluation questions are relevant to staff, meaningful to Black community members, and credible to funders.</li><li>Confirm or revise the specific activities that are delivered by the program and that are essential to the program. Include direct services to Black community members as well as other essential elements such as collaboration with other organizations, staff training and financial management.</li><li>Confirm or revise the key interest groups that should be engaged in data collection and/or discussion of the results.</li><li>Finalize the evaluation framework, confirming that the indicators are measurable and meaningful.</li></ul><h3 id="phase-3-develop-and-test-data-collection-tools">Phase 3. Develop and test data collection tools</h3><ul><li>Review and possibly adapt current client record system if one exists to assess whether it can generate reports for Black community member goals, milestones and activities. For example, every Black community member should be asked what they hope to get from the services, and if feasible asked later if they achieved their goals.</li><li>Draft all data collection tools (surveys, interview guides, tracking sheets). If possible, adapt and customize them from existing validated data collection tools to save time and improve validity.</li><li>Pilot test the tools with a small group of Black community members and staff to ensure clarity and cultural appropriateness.</li><li>Refine tools based on pilot feedback.</li></ul><h3 id="phase-4-collect-and-manage-data">Phase 4. Collect and manage data</h3><ul><li>Train staff or designated data collectors on protocols to ensure data quality and consistency.</li><li>Deploy surveys, conduct interviews, and analyze client records as per the evaluation framework.</li><li>Ensure ethical protocols, including informed consent and data confidentiality, are strictly followed.</li><li>Frequent interim reports will assess whether the data appears to be accurate and whether it captures feedback from defined interest groups and demographic groups.</li><li>If necessary, additional demographic segments may be targeted with additional interviews or financial incentives.</li></ul><h3 id="phase-5-analyze-data-and-interpret-findings">Phase 5. Analyze data and interpret findings</h3><ul><li>Clean and analyze quantitative and qualitative data.</li><li>Deliver reports frequently to appropriate staff and interest groups with a focus on recommended actions. Emerging findings may be tested with follow-up interviews or more detailed reports.</li><li>Notes from staff meetings will be reviewed for evidence of actions that have been taken or recommendations that have been made as a result of the reports.</li><li>Hold a "sense-making" session with the advisory committee and staff to interpret the initial findings, discuss implications, and co-develop recommendations. This participatory step is crucial for ensuring the results are understood and owned by the team.</li></ul><h3 id="phase-6-communicate-findings-and-facilitate-use">Phase 6. Communicate findings and facilitate use</h3><ul><li>Draft a comprehensive evaluation report with a clear executive summary.</li><li>Develop tailored communication materials for different groups (e.g., one-page summary for the board, presentation for staff, stories for a newsletter).</li><li>Facilitate a final meeting to discuss the report and create an action plan for implementing the recommendations.</li></ul></section><section class="content-section"><h2 id="roles-and-responsibilities">Roles and responsibilities</h2><p>It is necessary to involve senior managers and decision-makers in the evaluation process so that the resulting information will be relevant and credible to them.

The attendees represent the minimum roles required for a successful evaluation. Other roles may be invited depending on the needs of the project.</p><table class="standard-table"><thead><tr><th>Meeting Purpose</th><th>Deliverables</th><th>Minimum attendees (always includes project manager)</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Initiate the project</td><td>Draft of Evaluation Plan</td><td>Liaison</td><td>The agenda for this meeting is to clarify and confirm the evaluation's objectives, methodology, roles and timelines, using this report as a working draft. The Project Manager and Liaison revise this report with input from Statement of Work, proposal and program documents.</td></tr><tr><td>2. Define objectives, roles and key interest groups</td><td>Approved Evaluation Plan</td><td>Project Owner, Sponsor, Liaison, program staff</td><td>This meeting involves the organization's decision-makers and program staff to build engagement in the evaluation, to decide on priorities, and to commit on how they will handle problems as they arise. The completed Evaluation Plan is approved by the Sponsor shortly after the meeting.</td></tr><tr><td>3. Configure client record system and data collection tools</td><td>Revise or design client record system and approved data collection tools</td><td>Liaison, program staff</td><td>Use existing tools as much as possible. If further discussion needed offer additional meetings to subgroup</td></tr><tr><td>4. Track progress and troubleshoot problems</td><td>Progress report</td><td>Liaison</td><td>This can be combined with other meetings. The purpose is to discuss delays and solve problems as they arise.</td></tr><tr><td>5. Engage with data</td><td>Meeting notes with actions</td><td>Liaison, program staff (monthly at first, then bimonthly)</td><td>These meetings should be a recurring agenda item in regular program staff meetings, if feasible. Part of the purpose is to get staff accustomed to responding to Black community member feedback in their staff meetings as a normal reflective practice. Emerging conclusions should be addressed early and often so that staff get a chance to contribute to recommendations before they are presented to senior management.</td></tr><tr><td>6. Engage with recommendations</td><td>Revised conclusions and recommendations</td><td>Project Owner, Project Sponsor, Liaison, Project Owner, program staff</td><td>This may require multiple meetings with different interest groups, with revisions at each stage incorporating their feedback. The meetings should present only conclusions and recommendations to encourage discussion. Technical details should be available for questions and circulated to interested interest groups.</td></tr></tbody></table><hr>
