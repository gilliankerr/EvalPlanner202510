The evaluation approach is designed to provide useful information for program staff, management, and funders with minimal time spent in initial planning, logic modelling, creating an evaluation framework, and so on.  It helps evaluation teams move quickly to data collection, analysis and engagement by streamlining the planning phase. </p><p>This plan does not include citations or research references. It is based on the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4815131">LogicalOutcomes Evaluation Planning Handbook</a> by Gillian Kerr and Sophie Llewelyn, which describes a structured process that relies on general evidence about effective nonprofit programs, supported by an in-depth web search about the program itself. </p><p>We recommend that users also carry out a quick literature review to check that the program’s design is consistent with research and evidence about its effectiveness with the target population.  For a free research scan we suggest <a href="https://consensus.app/">Consensus</a>. Ask something like, ‘What are likely to be essential program delivery elements and critical success factors for (type of program) serving (target population)? You can export the report and attach it to this evaluation plan. </p><p>If the draft evaluation plan is not accurate, you can paste additional information about the program or community into the ‘About the Program’ box and try the app again. Or you can just use it as a rough draft and make your own changes. </p><section class="content-section"><h2 id="program-summary-and-analysis">Program summary and analysis</h2><h3 id="summary-of-the-program">Summary of the program</h3><p>Black Health Alliance (BHA) is a community-led registered charity working to improve the health and well-being of Black communities in Canada. BHA centres Black communities in defining challenges and co-designing solutions across health promotion and community engagement, research and policy, and strategy, design and implementation.</p><p>All Programs aims to reduce health inequities by addressing social determinants of health, anti-Black racism, and fragmented services. BHA serves Black community members (youth, adults, elders, newcomers, and families) and works with partners across health, social, education, and policy systems. Key activities include community outreach and health promotion, peer and lived-experience engagement, participatory research and knowledge mobilization, policy advocacy, provider training, implementation support, and coalition-building to foster connected communities.

Co-design sessions and lived-experience leadership surface barriers and shape solutions that fit local contexts.</li><li>Evidence and policy: BHA conducts community-based research, translates knowledge into practical tools (briefs, reports, toolkits), and advances policy and funding aligned with anti-racism and equity.</li><li>Strategy, design, and implementation: BHA provides technical assistance to providers and systems to redesign pathways (e.g., referrals and navigation), trains staff in culturally safe and anti-racist practice, and supports implementation and evaluation to scale promising practices.</li><li>Building connected communities: BHA convenes coalitions and networks, aligns partners around shared goals and indicators, and strengthens infrastructure for collective impact.</li></ul><p>Participant journeys</p><ul><li>For Black community members: Outreach and invitation → culturally tailored workshops or campaigns → optional peer navigation and referrals → follow-up to support service access and continuity → feedback on experience and outcomes.</li><li>For providers and partners: Readiness and needs assessment → training and coaching → pathway redesign and pilot implementation → fidelity checks and adaptation → shared measurement and learning → policy/practice adoption and scale-up.</li></ul><h3 id="activities">Activities</h3><ul><li>Health promotion &amp; community engagement<ul><li>Attending culturally tailored workshops and outreach events</li><li>Receiving navigation support from peer or lived-experience leaders</li><li>Participating in campaigns that promote screening, mental health, and preventive care</li><li>Joining listening sessions and feedback circles to shape services</li></ul></li><li>Co-design and community leadership<ul><li>Participating in co-design sessions to define problems and solutions</li><li>Contributing lived-experience to tools, materials, and prototypes</li><li>Serving on advisory groups with honoraria and clear roles</li></ul></li><li>Research &amp; policy<ul><li>Joining community-based studies and surveys</li><li>Reviewing plain-language briefs on findings and implications</li><li>Providing input to policy consultations and public forums</li><li>Using toolkits and resources developed from research</li></ul></li><li>Strategy, design &amp; implementation support<ul><li>Receiving provider training in anti-racist, culturally safe practice</li><li>Participating in pathway redesign (e.g., more accessible referrals)</li><li>Receiving implementation coaching and quality improvement support</li><li>Using practice guidelines, SOPs, and simple fidelity tools</li></ul></li><li>Building connected communities<ul><li>Joining coalition meetings and community convenings</li><li>Aligning on shared goals, indicators, and data dashboards</li><li>Sharing stories of impact and lessons learned across partners</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="key-management-processes">Key management processes</h3><p>Several management processes must be properly implemented to make for an effective program. </p><ul><li>Feedback and quality control: Establish a simple, ongoing feedback loop across all pillars. Use short pulse checks after workshops, quick debriefs after navigation encounters, and partner feedback forms after trainings. Track suggestions and actions taken in a shared log to inform continuous improvement.</li><li>Participatory decision-making: Engage Black community members and lived-experience leaders in co-design, advisory groups, and sense-making sessions. Ensure paid participation, accessible formats, and transparent follow-up on how feedback changes activities.</li><li>Staff development: Provide continuous training for staff and peer navigators in cultural safety, trauma-informed practice, anti-racism/anti-oppression, implementation support, and ethical community-based research. Offer reflective practice and supervision to prevent burnout.</li><li>Resource management: Monitor budgets, staff time, and partner contributions. Use simple dashboards to track delivery against the 2022–2025 strategic plan, including milestones for pilots, research outputs, and policy efforts.</li><li>Partnership management: Use MOUs, readiness assessments, and regular check-ins with health, social, education, and community partners. Clarify roles for pathway changes, data sharing, and shared measurement.</li><li>Community data governance and privacy: Apply purpose-limited consent, role-based access, and de-identification. Use community oversight for race-based data, and maintain clear data-sharing agreements.</li><li>Safety and accessibility protocols: Conduct risk assessments for community events, ensure accessibility (transport, childcare, translation, virtual options), and maintain incident reporting and follow-up procedures.</li></ul><h3 id="main-interest-groups">Main interest groups</h3><table class="standard-table"><thead><tr><th>Interest group</th><th>What they hope for</th><th>Potential program risks (from their perspective)</th><th>Risk mitigation strategies</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Black community members</td><td>Culturally safe, trustworthy supports;

Develop and test data collection tools</h3><ul><li>Review and possibly adapt current client record system if one exists to assess whether it can generate reports for Black community member goals, milestones and activities. For example, every Black community member should be asked what they hope to get from the activities, and if feasible asked later if they achieved their goals.</li><li>Draft all data collection tools (surveys, interview guides, tracking sheets).

The attendees represent the minimum roles required for a successful evaluation. Other roles may be invited depending on the needs of the project.</p><table class="standard-table"><thead><tr><th>Meeting Purpose</th><th>Deliverables</th><th>Minimum attendees (always includes project manager)</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Initiate the project</td><td>Draft of Evaluation Plan</td><td>Liaison</td><td>The agenda for this meeting is to clarify and confirm the evaluation's objectives, methodology, roles and timelines, using this report as a working draft. The Project Manager and Liaison revise this report with input from Statement of Work, proposal and program documents.</td></tr><tr><td>2. Define objectives, roles and key interest groups</td><td>Approved Evaluation Plan</td><td>Project Owner, Sponsor, Liaison, program staff</td><td>This meeting involves the organization's decision-makers and program staff to build engagement in the evaluation, to decide on priorities, and to commit on how they will handle problems as they arise. The completed Evaluation Plan is approved by the Sponsor shortly after the meeting.</td></tr><tr><td>3. Configure client record system and data collection tools</td><td>Revise or design client record system and approved data collection tools</td><td>Liaison, program staff</td><td>Use existing tools as much as possible. If further discussion needed offer additional meetings to subgroup</td></tr><tr><td>4. Track progress and troubleshoot problems</td><td>Progress report</td><td>Liaison</td><td>This can be combined with other meetings. The purpose is to discuss delays and solve problems as they arise.</td></tr><tr><td>5. Engage with data</td><td>Meeting notes with actions</td><td>Liaison, program staff (monthly at first, then bimonthly)</td><td>These meetings should be a recurring agenda item in regular program staff meetings, if feasible. Part of the purpose is to get staff accustomed to responding to Black community member feedback in their staff meetings as a normal reflective practice. Emerging conclusions should be addressed early and often so that staff get a chance to contribute to recommendations before they are presented to senior management.</td></tr><tr><td>6. Engage with recommendations</td><td>Revised conclusions and recommendations</td><td>Project Owner, Project Sponsor, Liaison, Project Owner, program staff</td><td>This may require multiple meetings with different interest groups, with revisions at each stage incorporating their feedback. The meetings should present only conclusions and recommendations to encourage discussion. Technical details should be available for questions and circulated to interested interest groups.</td></tr></tbody></table><hr>
