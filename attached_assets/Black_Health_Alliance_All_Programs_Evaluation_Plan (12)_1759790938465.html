The evaluation approach is designed to provide useful information for program staff, management, and funders with minimal time spent in initial planning, logic modelling, creating an evaluation framework, and so on.  It helps evaluation teams move quickly to data collection, analysis and engagement by streamlining the planning phase. </p><p>This plan does not include citations or research references. It is based on the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4815131">LogicalOutcomes Evaluation Planning Handbook</a> by Gillian Kerr and Sophie Llewelyn, which describes a structured process that relies on general evidence about effective nonprofit programs, supported by an in-depth web search about the program itself. </p><p>We recommend that users also carry out a quick literature review to check that the program’s design is consistent with research and evidence about its effectiveness with the target population.  For a free research scan we suggest <a href="https://consensus.app/">Consensus</a>. Ask something like, ‘What are likely to be essential program delivery elements and critical success factors for (type of program) serving (target population)? You can export the report and attach it to this evaluation plan. </p><p>If the draft evaluation plan is not accurate, you can paste additional information about the program or community into the ‘About the Program’ box and try the app again. Or you can just use it as a rough draft and make your own changes. </p><section class="content-section"><h2 id="program-summary-and-analysis">Program summary and analysis</h2><h3 id="summary-of-the-program">Summary of the program</h3><p>Black Health Alliance (BHA) is a community-led registered charity working to improve the health and well-being of Black communities in Canada (<a href="https://blackhealthalliance.ca/">https://blackhealthalliance.ca/</a>). BHA centres Black communities in defining challenges and co-designing solutions, focusing on social determinants of health, health inequities, anti-Black racism, and building connected communities.</p><p>Across All Programs, BHA’s primary activities include health promotion and community engagement, research and policy, and strategy, design and implementation. The organization convenes partners, mobilizes evidence, and provides technical assistance so that systems and services become more equitable and culturally safe for Black community members.</p><h3 id="program-overview">Program overview</h3><p>BHA’s All Programs operate as an integrated portfolio that addresses structural inequities and improves health outcomes for Black communities. The work is organized through three core service lines: Health Promotion &amp; Community Engagement; Research and Policy; and Strategy, Design &amp; Implementation. Knowledge mobilization underpins all three, ensuring that community-generated evidence informs practice and policy.</p><p>Community members typically engage with BHA through outreach, workshops, forums, and campaigns tailored to local needs. BHA supports community leadership development and peer facilitation, and it convenes multi-sector partners to co-design interventions. Research and policy efforts use community-based and participatory approaches to generate and translate evidence on Black health inequities into actionable recommendations. Strategy, design and implementation supports include technical assistance, training, and coaching to help organizations adopt anti-racist, culturally safe practices, as well as backbone support for collaboratives.</p><p>The intended journey emphasizes co-design and shared accountability: community members articulate priorities; BHA and partners translate these into strategies; pilots are implemented with coaching and shared measurement; and successful approaches are scaled and embedded in policy and practice.</p><h3 id="activities">Activities</h3><ul><li>Health promotion and community engagement<ul><li>Attending community outreach events, workshops and forums</li><li>Participating in peer-led groups and leadership development</li><li>Joining co-design sessions to define needs and solutions</li></ul></li><li>Research and policy<ul><li>Participating in community-based and participatory research</li><li>Reviewing and sharing findings on Black health inequities</li><li>Engaging in policy dialogues, briefings and consultations</li></ul></li><li>Strategy, design and implementation<ul><li>Co-developing tools, protocols and pilots with partners</li><li>Receiving training and coaching on anti-racism and cultural safety</li><li>Joining collaboratives with shared goals and measures</li></ul></li><li>Knowledge mobilization and communications<ul><li>Accessing toolkits, briefs, webinars and media content</li><li>Sharing stories and insights to shift narratives</li><li>Tracking progress through shared dashboards and updates</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="key-management-processes">Key management processes</h3><p>Several management processes must be properly implemented to make for an effective program. </p><ul><li>Feedback and quality control: Establish an ongoing, multi-channel feedback system (listening sessions, post-event quick polls, partner debriefs) to inform rapid improvements in engagements, training, research dissemination, and implementation supports. Include a standing agenda item in staff meetings for reviewing community feedback and equity metrics.</li><li>Participatory decision-making: Engage Black community members in shaping priorities and decisions through paid advisory panels, co-design workshops, and participatory governance for collaboratives. Document decisions and how community input is acted upon.</li><li>Staff development: Provide continuous professional development on anti-Black racism, cultural safety, trauma-informed practice, CBPR methods, facilitation, implementation coaching, and data ethics. Offer regular supervision and reflective practice.</li><li>Resource management: Monitor budgets, staff effort, and in-kind contributions. Use workplans and milestone tracking for projects, ensuring adequate resourcing for engagement, data stewardship, and accessibility supports (e.g., childcare, honoraria, translation).</li><li>Partnership and backbone management: Use MOUs with clear roles, resources and decision rules. Facilitate cross-sector convenings, maintain shared agendas and measures, and steward partner accountability.</li><li>Community data governance and privacy: Maintain a community data governance charter; apply privacy-by-design, informed consent, de-identification, and data minimization. Review all data collection for necessity and potential harms.</li><li>Equity and cultural responsiveness protocols: Apply equity impact assessments to major outputs; ensure materials are accessible and culturally relevant; track disaggregated participation and outcomes to identify gaps and adapt accordingly.</li></ul><h3 id="main-interest-groups">Main interest groups</h3><table class="standard-table"><thead><tr><th>Interest group</th><th>What they hope for</th><th>Potential risks from their perspective</th><th>Risk mitigation strategies</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Black community members</td><td>Culturally safe access;

Define evaluation objectives and questions</h3><ul><li>Facilitate a meeting with the advisory committee to discuss and revise the evaluation objectives and questions.</li><li>Ensure evaluation questions are relevant to staff, meaningful to community members, and credible to funders.</li><li>Confirm or revise the specific activities that are delivered by the program and that are essential to the program. Include direct services to community members as well as other essential elements such as collaboration with other organizations, staff training and financial management.</li><li>Confirm or revise the key interest groups that should be engaged in data collection and/or discussion of the results.</li><li>Finalize the evaluation framework, confirming that the indicators are measurable and meaningful.</li></ul><h3 id="phase-3-develop-and-test-data-collection-tools">Phase 3. Develop and test data collection tools</h3><ul><li>Review and possibly adapt current client record system if one exists to assess whether it can generate reports for community member goals, milestones and activities. For example, every community member should be asked what they hope to get from the services, and if feasible asked later if they achieved their goals.</li><li>Draft all data collection tools (surveys, interview guides, tracking sheets). If possible, adapt and customize them from existing validated data collection tools to save time and improve validity.</li><li>Pilot test the tools with a small group of community members and staff to ensure clarity and cultural appropriateness.</li><li>Refine tools based on pilot feedback.</li></ul><h3 id="phase-4-collect-and-manage-data">Phase 4.

The attendees represent the minimum roles required for a successful evaluation. Other roles may be invited depending on the needs of the project.</p><table class="standard-table"><thead><tr><th>Meeting Purpose</th><th>Deliverables</th><th>Minimum attendees (always includes project manager)</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Initiate the project</td><td>Draft of Evaluation Plan</td><td>Liaison</td><td>The agenda for this meeting is to clarify and confirm the evaluation's objectives, methodology, roles and timelines, using this report as a working draft. The Project Manager and Liaison revise this report with input from Statement of Work, proposal and program documents.</td></tr><tr><td>2. Define objectives, roles and key interest groups</td><td>Approved Evaluation Plan</td><td>Project Owner, Sponsor, Liaison, program staff</td><td>This meeting involves the organization's decision-makers and program staff to build engagement in the evaluation, to decide on priorities, and to commit on how they will handle problems as they arise. The completed Evaluation Plan is approved by the Sponsor shortly after the meeting.</td></tr><tr><td>3. Configure client record system and data collection tools</td><td>Revise or design client record system and approved data collection tools</td><td>Liaison, program staff</td><td>Use existing tools as much as possible. If further discussion needed offer additional meetings to subgroup</td></tr><tr><td>4. Track progress and troubleshoot problems</td><td>Progress report</td><td>Liaison</td><td>This can be combined with other meetings. The purpose is to discuss delays and solve problems as they arise.</td></tr><tr><td>5. Engage with data</td><td>Meeting notes with actions</td><td>Liaison, program staff (monthly at first, then bimonthly)</td><td>These meetings should be a recurring agenda item in regular program staff meetings, if feasible. Part of the purpose is to get staff accustomed to responding to community member feedback in their staff meetings as a normal reflective practice. Emerging conclusions should be addressed early and often so that staff get a chance to contribute to recommendations before they are presented to senior management.</td></tr><tr><td>6. Engage with recommendations</td><td>Revised conclusions and recommendations</td><td>Project Owner, Project Sponsor, Liaison, Project Owner, program staff</td><td>This may require multiple meetings with different interest groups, with revisions at each stage incorporating their feedback. The meetings should present only conclusions and recommendations to encourage discussion. Technical details should be available for questions and circulated to interested interest groups.</td></tr></tbody></table><hr>
