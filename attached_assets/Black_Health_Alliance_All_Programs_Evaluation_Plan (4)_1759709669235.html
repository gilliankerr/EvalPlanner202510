The approach is collaborative and aims to provide actionable insights for program staff, management, and funders. It is guided by the principles of practical, utilization-focused evaluation.</p><p>This plan does not include citations or research references. It is based on the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4815131">LogicalOutcomes Evaluation Planning Handbook</a> by Gillian Kerr and Sophie Llewelyn, which describes a structured process that relies on general evidence about effective nonprofit programs, supported by an in-depth web search.</p><p>We recommend that users also carry out a literature review to check that the evaluation plan is supported by peer-reviewed evidence in research journals. Our current recommended AI literature search tools are <a href="https://www.undermind.ai/">Undermind</a> followed by <a href="https://platform.futurehouse.org/">FutureHouse Falcon</a> and <a href="https://consensus.app/">Consensus</a>. The <a href="https://www.undermind.ai/">Undermind</a> prompt should be something like, "I want to find empirical research (including peer-reviewed publications and high-quality gray literature) identifying essential program delivery elements and critical success factors for community health promotion programs serving Black communities in Canada." <a href="https://www.undermind.ai/">Undermind</a> will then interview you to refine the prompt. You can then re-do this evaluation plan app and paste in the relevant parts of the literature review into 'About the program'.</p><section class="content-section"><h2 id="program-summary-and-analysis">Program summary and analysis</h2><h3 id="summary-of-the-program">Summary of the program</h3><p>The Black Health Alliance is a community-led registered charity focused on improving the health and well-being of Black communities in Canada.

The phases are designed to build on each other, from foundational planning and engagement to data analysis and reporting. The intent is to focus evaluation resources as much as possible on understanding and responding to interest group perspectives and on improving program quality.</p><p>The evaluation project includes the following activities divided into four overlapping phases:</p><ul><li><strong>Planning and initiation</strong>: Activities 1 – 5 (duration: 3 to 8 weeks)</li><li><strong>Design and development</strong>: Activities 5 – 9 (duration: 1 to 12 weeks)</li><li><strong>Implementation and analysis</strong>: Activities 9 – 11 (ongoing until project completion)</li><li><strong>Communication and discussion</strong>: Activities 11 – 12 (duration: 3 to 6 weeks)</li></ul><h3 id="phase-1-engage-the-project-sponsor-team-members-and-key-decision-makers">Phase 1. Engage the project sponsor, team members, and key decision-makers</h3><ul><li>Confirm evaluation scope, budget and delivery date for the final report.</li><li>Define the main roles and responsibilities for the evaluation project, including the manager who is overseeing the project and who will be taking the recommendations to senior management.</li><li>Identify and invite members to an Evaluation Advisory Committee.</li><li>Define the timelines, resources (including staff effort for interviews and data collection) and the decision process for approval of final report.</li></ul><h3 id="phase-2-define-evaluation-objectives-and-questions">Phase 2. Define evaluation objectives and questions</h3><ul><li>Facilitate a meeting with the advisory committee to discuss and revise the evaluation objectives and questions.</li><li>Ensure evaluation questions are relevant to staff, meaningful to participants, and credible to funders.</li><li>Confirm or revise the specific activities that are delivered by the program and that are essential to the program. Include direct services to participants as well as other essential elements such as collaboration with other organizations, staff training and financial management.</li><li>Confirm or revise the key interest groups that should be engaged in data collection and/or discussion of the results.</li><li>Finalize the evaluation framework, confirming that the indicators are measurable and meaningful.</li></ul><h3 id="phase-3-develop-and-test-data-collection-tools">Phase 3. Develop and test data collection tools</h3><ul><li>Review and possibly adapt current client record system if one exists to assess whether it can generate reports for participant goals, milestones and activities. For example, every participant should be asked what they hope to get from the services, and if feasible asked later if they achieved their goals.</li><li>Draft all data collection tools (surveys, interview guides, tracking sheets). If possible, adapt and customize them from existing validated data collection tools to save time and improve validity.</li><li>Pilot test the tools with a small group of participants and staff to ensure clarity and cultural appropriateness.</li><li>Refine tools based on pilot feedback.</li></ul><h3 id="phase-4-collect-and-manage-data">Phase 4. Collect and manage data</h3><ul><li>Train staff or designated data collectors on protocols to ensure data quality and consistency.</li><li>Deploy surveys, conduct interviews, and analyze client records as per the evaluation framework.</li><li>Ensure ethical protocols, including informed consent and data confidentiality, are strictly followed.</li><li>Frequent interim reports will assess whether the data appears to be accurate and whether it captures feedback from defined interest groups and demographic groups.</li><li>If necessary, additional demographic segments may be targeted with additional interviews or financial incentives.</li></ul><h3 id="phase-5-analyze-data-and-interpret-findings">Phase 5. Analyze data and interpret findings</h3><ul><li>Clean and analyze quantitative and qualitative data.</li><li>Deliver reports frequently to appropriate staff and interest groups with a focus on recommended actions. Emerging findings may be tested with follow-up interviews or more detailed reports.</li><li>Notes from staff meetings will be reviewed for evidence of actions that have been taken or recommendations that have been made as a result of the reports.</li><li>Hold a "sense-making" session with the advisory committee and staff to interpret the initial findings, discuss implications, and co-develop recommendations. This participatory step is crucial for ensuring the results are understood and owned by the team.</li></ul><h3 id="phase-6-communicate-findings-and-facilitate-use">Phase 6. Communicate findings and facilitate use</h3><ul><li>Draft a comprehensive evaluation report with a clear executive summary.</li><li>Develop tailored communication materials for different groups (e.g., one-page summary for the board, presentation for staff, stories for a newsletter).</li><li>Facilitate a final meeting to discuss the report and create an action plan for implementing the recommendations.</li></ul></section><section class="content-section"><h2 id="roles-and-responsibilities">Roles and responsibilities</h2><p>It is necessary to involve senior managers and decision-makers in the evaluation process so that the resulting information will be relevant and credible to them.

The attendees represent the minimum roles required for a successful evaluation. Other roles may be invited depending on the needs of the project.</p><table class="standard-table"><thead><tr><th>Meeting Purpose</th><th>Deliverables</th><th>Minimum attendees (always includes project manager)</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Initiate the project</td><td>Draft of Evaluation Plan</td><td>Liaison</td><td>The agenda for this meeting is to clarify and confirm the evaluation's objectives, methodology, roles and timelines, using this report as a working draft. The Project Manager and Liaison revise this report with input from Statement of Work, proposal and program documents.</td></tr><tr><td>2. Define objectives, roles and key interest groups</td><td>Approved Evaluation Plan</td><td>Project Owner, Sponsor, Liaison, program staff</td><td>This meeting involves the organization's decision-makers and program staff to build engagement in the evaluation, to decide on priorities, and to commit on how they will handle problems as they arise. The completed Evaluation Plan is approved by the Sponsor shortly after the meeting.</td></tr><tr><td>3. Configure client record system and data collection tools</td><td>Revise or design client record system and approved data collection tools</td><td>Liaison, program staff</td><td>Use existing tools as much as possible. If further discussion needed offer additional meetings to subgroup</td></tr><tr><td>4. Track progress and troubleshoot problems</td><td>Progress report</td><td>Liaison</td><td>This can be combined with other meetings. The purpose is to discuss delays and solve problems as they arise.</td></tr><tr><td>5. Engage with data</td><td>Meeting notes with actions</td><td>Liaison, program staff (monthly at first, then bimonthly)</td><td>These meetings should be a recurring agenda item in regular program staff meetings, if feasible. Part of the purpose is to get staff accustomed to responding to participant feedback in their staff meetings as a normal reflective practice. Emerging conclusions should be addressed early and often so that staff get a chance to contribute to recommendations before they are presented to senior management.</td></tr><tr><td>6. Engage with recommendations</td><td>Revised conclusions and recommendations</td><td>Project Owner, Project Sponsor, Liaison, Project Owner, program staff</td><td>This may require multiple meetings with different interest groups, with revisions at each stage incorporating their feedback. The meetings should present only conclusions and recommendations to encourage discussion. Technical details should be available for questions and circulated to interested interest groups.</td></tr></tbody></table><hr>
