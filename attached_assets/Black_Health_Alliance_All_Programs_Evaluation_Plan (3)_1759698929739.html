The approach is collaborative and aims to provide actionable insights for program staff, management, and funders. It is guided by the principles of practical, utilization-focused evaluation.</p><p>This plan does not include citations or research references. It is based on the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4815131">LogicalOutcomes Evaluation Planning Handbook</a>, which describes a structured process that relies on general evidence about effective nonprofit programs, supported by an in-depth web search.</p><p>We recommend that users also carry out a literature review to check that the evaluation plan is supported by peer-reviewed evidence in research journals. Our current recommended AI literature search tools are <a href="https://www.undermind.ai/">Undermind</a> followed by <a href="https://platform.futurehouse.org/">FutureHouse Falcon</a> and <a href="https://consensus.app/">Consensus</a>. The <a href="https://www.undermind.ai/">Undermind</a> prompt should be something like, "I want to find empirical research (including peer-reviewed publications and high-quality gray literature) identifying essential program delivery elements and critical success factors for [type of program] serving [brief description of target population]." <a href="https://www.undermind.ai/">Undermind</a> will then interview you to refine the prompt. You can then re-do this evaluation plan app and paste in the relevant parts of the literature review into 'About the program'.</p><section class="content-section"><h2 id="program-summary-and-analysis">Program summary and analysis</h2><h3 id="summary-of-the-program">Summary of the program</h3><p>According to the program description, Black Health Alliance (BHA) is a community-led registered charity that works in partnership to improve the health and well-being of Black communities in Canada. BHA focuses on four strategic areas: Social Determinants of Health, Health Inequities, Anti-Black Racism, and Building Connected Communities. Its work is delivered through three pillars: Health Promotion &amp; Community Engagement; Research and Policy; and Strategy, Design &amp; Implementation.</p><p>Based on the program model research from the previous analysis, BHA’s “All Programs” portfolio serves Black community members across the life course, including immigrants, refugees, and Canadian-born Black populations. BHA centers Black communities to define problems and co-design solutions, mobilizes partners and investments, and translates community-informed research into policy and practice change to improve equitable access, care experiences, and health outcomes.</p><h3 id="program-overview">Program overview</h3><p>According to the program description, BHA engages Black communities to surface challenges and barriers affecting health and well-being and provides a platform for a common voice to address systemic problems. BHA convenes partners, co-designs solutions, and supports implementation to achieve measurable, sustained change. The organization is guided by a 2022–2025 strategic plan (“THRIVE”) that outlines its theory of change, priorities, and actions.</p><p>Based on the program model research from the previous analysis, All Programs integrates three core components:</p><ul><li>Health Promotion &amp; Community Engagement: culturally relevant outreach, education, and navigation supports; community forums and listening sessions; peer and lay health advisor approaches to connect Black community members to resources.</li><li>Research and Policy: community-based participatory research, data generation and dissemination, race-based data governance, and policy analysis/advocacy to address structural drivers of inequity.</li><li>Strategy, Design &amp; Implementation: co-design of services with Black community members and partners; provider training on anti-Black racism and cultural safety; implementation support, quality improvement, and shared measurement to scale effective practices.</li></ul><p>A typical journey for a Black community member includes connecting with BHA through outreach or a community event, learning about relevant health topics and rights, participating in co-design or feedback activities, and, where available through partners, receiving navigation or referral support to culturally safe services. In parallel, providers and system partners engage with BHA for capacity building, co-design, and implementation support that lead to policy and practice changes benefiting Black community members.</p><h3 id="activities">Activities</h3><p>Based on the program model research from the previous analysis, the following activities reflect how Black community members and partners experience All Programs. Activities are grouped under BHA’s three pillars.</p><ul><li>Health Promotion &amp; Community Engagement<ul><li>Attending culturally relevant health education sessions, town halls, and forums</li><li>Receiving navigation and referral support to services and resources</li><li>Participating in listening sessions, advisory circles, and co-design workshops</li><li>Accessing digital resources and communications tailored to Black communities</li></ul></li><li>Research and Policy<ul><li>Participating in community-led research (surveys, interviews, focus groups) with informed consent</li><li>Reviewing accessible summaries of findings and contributing to recommendations</li><li>Joining policy dialogues, consultations, and advocacy efforts that reflect community priorities</li></ul></li><li>Strategy, Design &amp; Implementation<ul><li>Co-designing program models and service improvements with BHA and partners</li><li>Providing feedback on provider training content (anti-Black racism, cultural safety)</li><li>Taking part in pilot programs and quality improvement cycles and sharing experiences to refine solutions</li></ul></li></ul><p>Programs of this type typically also include behind-the-scenes activities such as partnership development, shared measurement/data dashboards, and communications to elevate community narratives and drive systems change.</p><h3 id="key-management-processes">Key management processes</h3><p>Several management processes must be properly implemented for an effective program. The following processes are defined in the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4815131">LogicalOutcomes Evaluation Planning Handbook</a>, supplemented by the web search and prior analysis.</p><ul><li>Feedback and quality control: Establish ongoing feedback loops with Black community members, including listening sessions, post-event quick polls, and optional follow-up calls. Use team debriefs to review feedback, track changes made, and document learnings. Where feasible, embed short reflective questions into activities to capture immediate suggestions.</li><li>Participatory decision-making: Engage Black community members as paid advisors and co-designers. Use community advisory circles to set priorities for health promotion topics, research questions, and policy positions. Share back results (“you said, we did”) to maintain transparency and trust.</li><li>Staff development: Provide continuous training and reflective supervision in anti-Black racism, cultural safety, trauma- and resilience-informed practice, community-based research ethics, and facilitation. Offer wellness supports to reduce burnout and vicarious trauma.</li><li>Resource management: Monitor budgets, staff time, and partner in-kind contributions across multi-year initiatives. Align funding with strategic priorities (2022–2025 plan), and phase projects to match capacity. Track cost-effectiveness where possible.</li><li>Partnership management: Maintain MOUs and clear roles with community-based organizations, health and social service providers, and academic partners. Use shared goals, milestones, and simple data-sharing agreements with privacy safeguards. Identify champions within partner organizations.</li><li>Race-based data governance and privacy: Implement community-governed data protocols with informed consent, data minimization, de-identification, and secure storage. Ensure community approval before public dissemination of disaggregated findings.</li><li>Cultural responsiveness protocols: Ensure materials and events are culturally relevant, accessible, and safe (e.g., plain language, multilingual options, child care or transportation supports, hybrid delivery). Apply ethical storytelling practices to avoid harm and stigma.</li></ul><h3 id="main-interest-groups">Main interest groups</h3><p>The table below summarizes key interest groups, their hopes, risks from their perspective, and mitigation strategies.</p><table class="standard-table"><thead><tr><th>Interest group</th><th>What they hope for</th><th>Risks from their perspective</th><th>Risk mitigation strategies</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Black community members (youth, elders, newcomers, women, LGBTQ+, people with disabilities)</td><td>Respectful, culturally safe supports;

Initiate the project</td><td>Draft of Evaluation Plan</td><td>Liaison</td><td>The agenda for this meeting is to clarify and confirm the evaluation's objectives, methodology, roles and timelines, using this report as a working draft. The Project Manager and Liaison revise this report with input from Statement of Work, proposal and program documents.</td></tr><tr><td>2. Define objectives, roles and key interest groups</td><td>Approved Evaluation Plan</td><td>Project Owner, Sponsor, Liaison, program staff</td><td>This meeting involves the organization's decision-makers and program staff to build engagement in the evaluation, to decide on priorities, and to commit on how they will handle problems as they arise. The completed Evaluation Plan is approved by the Sponsor shortly after the meeting.</td></tr><tr><td>3. Configure client record system and data collection tools</td><td>Revise or design client record system and approved data collection tools</td><td>Liaison, program staff</td><td>Use existing tools as much as possible. If further discussion needed offer additional meetings to subgroup</td></tr><tr><td>4. Track progress and troubleshoot problems</td><td>Progress report</td><td>Liaison</td><td>This can be combined with other meetings. The purpose is to discuss delays and solve problems as they arise.</td></tr><tr><td>5. Engage with data</td><td>Meeting notes with actions</td><td>Liaison, program staff (monthly at first, then bimonthly)</td><td>These meetings should be a recurring agenda item in regular program staff meetings, if feasible. Part of the purpose is to get staff accustomed to responding to Black community member feedback in their staff meetings as a normal reflective practice. Emerging conclusions should be addressed early and often so that staff get a chance to contribute to recommendations before they are presented to senior management.</td></tr><tr><td>6. Engage with recommendations</td><td>Revised conclusions and recommendations</td><td>Project Owner, Project Sponsor, Liaison, Project Owner, program staff</td><td>This may require multiple meetings with different interest groups, with revisions at each stage incorporating their feedback. The meetings should present only conclusions and recommendations to encourage discussion. Technical details should be available for questions and circulated to interested interest groups.</td></tr></tbody></table><hr>
